# REINVENT data

This repository contains the data used in our paper [A Virtual Reality Muscle-Computer-Interface for Neurorehabilitation in
Chronic Stroke: A Pilot Study](link)

# Notes

Similar to our previous work (Vourvopoulos et al.) data was acquired using the [Labstreaming Layer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer) protocol, and thus recorded as independent streams of data timestamped and saved as .xdf files.

The _data_ folder contains .mat files that correspond to the extracted .xdf files and respectively downsampling and interpolating signals to a common sample rate of 1000 Hz. Data was stored in individual files for each participant, during each session and per block of trials.

The file _sensors2020data_ contains the processed data used to create the [figures and statistical comparisons](/docs/index.html) shown in Marin-Pardo et al.
