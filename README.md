# REINVENT data

This repository contains the data used in our paper [A Virtual Reality Muscle-Computer-Interface for Neurorehabilitation in
Chronic Stroke: A Pilot Study](link)

# Notes

As mentioned in Vourvopoulos et al, data was acquired using the Labstreaming Layer protocol, and thus recorded as independent streams of data timestamped and saved as .xdf files.
The _data_ folder contains the acquired data after extracting the xdf files and respectively downsampling and interpolating signals to a common sample rate of 1000 Hz. Data was stored in individual .mat files for each participant, during each session and per block of trials.

The _figures_ folder contains the processed data and the R code that created the figures in Marin-Pardo et al.
